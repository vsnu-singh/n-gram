# n-gram

This is implementation of n-gram modal using bayes theoram
We intend to use basic data structures rather than prebuilt library to solve the issue
We must solve for large data sets too so that large dataset doesnot affect the speed of our model by builing caches
our n-gram modal predicts based upon words only no letters are used for prediction
